        "summary": "The first time Adeline Ivey danced into my life, high on ecstasy instead of life, was at the party before the kickoff of our seventh tour. I spotted her out on the lawn, a gorgeous girl spinning around in circles with her arms wide and a big smile directed at the Los Angeles sky.\n\nWe shared an insane summer on the road, surrounded by sex, drugs, and rock n' roll—a combination that could only end in disaster.\n\nThat was ten years ago. The world has forgotten Lincoln Hayes, rock god and guitarist in Path of Destruction. As the date of my parole hearing approaches, I'm nothing but a number in the system of the Michigan Department of Corrections. And as much as I want to forget the events of that summer and move on, the girl I can't get out of my head is trying to make an encore appearance in my life.",

He’s a self-made billionaire, and he’s heart-stoppingly gorgeous. Oh, and did I mention he’s into BDSM? Like… really into it. He says I can trust him, that he’ll take care of me, that nothing bad will happen so long as I’m his. His kitten. I want to believe him. I want to trust him. I want to surrender to the heat of his touch and submit. I want to let him have me in all the ways he wants me. But it’s not that simple. Nothing ever is. **This is a full-length, standalone billionaire BDSM romance. No cheating or cliffhangers, and as always, Happily Ever After guaranteed.",

Spoiler alert: it’s as sad as it sounds.\nMy roommate thinks I should do some research to help my writer’s block.\nWhen a billionaire publishing executive rejects my book, she has the perfect idea.\nThe perfectly terrible idea of tricking him into bidding on me through a BDSM site.\n\nI know how it sounds. Crazy. Stupid. Irresponsible. Check, check, check. I couldn’t agree more.\n\nYes, he’s practically dripping with sex appeal. Yes, any woman with a pulse would kill for a “hello” from him. And yes, he looks like he belongs on a movie screen.\n\nBut as far as I’m concerned, he’s just the jerk who rejected my book, and all I care about is getting a chance to tell him off in person. That’s it. Mostly.\n\nThen again, maybe my roommate has a point. A night with him would probably give me enough material to fill half a book.\n\nHe wants more than a night, though. He wants a month. And he wants me to sign a contract saying I’m completely and totally his.\n\nI can sign the contract and basically become the heroine from one of my books, or I can say no and keep on living my normal, boring life. Hmm, tough call…",
