  git clone git@github.com:LISims88/love-library.git
  cd love-library
  npm install
  npm start
  The server should be running on: localhost:3000

# Running Tests

  npx cypress open

From there the Cypress test runner will run. For more information on Cypress, check out the Cypress documentation

### Context
Love Library was developed in a little over one week at the Turing School of Software & Design. The project was a solo effort that was completed in approximately 50 programming hours. The primary goal was to build a comprehensive full-stack application.

### Lessons Learned
The primary objective was to create a full-stack application utilizing React for the frontend and Express, Knex, and PostgreSQL for the backend.  Key takeaways included understanding the importance of prioritizing the MVP features and learning a new CSS styling.

This project was a major lesson in strengthening my skills as Front End Developer with the Possibility of moving more towards Full Stack.
